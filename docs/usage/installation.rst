Package Installation
=====================

To install RascalC, simply clone the Github repository and compile the C++ code (see :ref:`dependencies` below). This is done as follows::

    git clone https://github.com/oliverphilcox/RascalC.git
    cd RascalC
    make

**NB**: RascalC can be run in various modes by adding compiler flags in the ``Makefile``. See :doc:`getting-started` and :doc:`main-code` for more information.
    
Once RascalC is installed, see the :doc:`getting-started` and :doc:`tutorial` sections.
