Covariance Matrix Estimation
=============================

This is the main section of RascalC, where a covariance matrix estimates are computed via Monte Carlo integration from a given set of input particles.

**NB**: Before running this code, the jackknife weights and binned pair counts must be computed 

Usage
~~~~~~~

The code is used as follows, with the command line options specified below::
    
    ./cov -def 

Options
