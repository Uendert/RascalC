# RascalC
**A Rapid Sampler For Large Cross-Covariance Matrices in C++**

C++ code to simulate anisotropic two-point correlation function covariance matrices from large surveys, using a grid and jackknife based approach. (Code developed by Alexander Wiegand, Daniel Eisenstein, Ross O'Connell and Oliver Philcox)

For full usage, see the ReadTheDocs [documentation](https://rascalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

Any usage of this code should cite [Philcox et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.11070.pdf)

***Coming Soon***: covariance matrices in Legendre polynomial bins and isotropic 3PCF covariances...
