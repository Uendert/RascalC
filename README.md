# RascalC
**A Rapid Sampler For Large Cross-Covariance Matrices in C++**

C++ code to simulate correlation function covariance matrices from large surveys, using a grid and jackknife based approach. (Code developed by Alexander Wiegand, Daniel Eisenstein, Ross O'Connell and Oliver Philcox)

For full usage, see the ReadTheDocs [documentation](https://rascalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
